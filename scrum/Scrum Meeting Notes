- In today's meeting, we went over progress for Milestone 2. We discussed some of the diagrams we individually created and altered them according to group suggestions. We fixed the class diagram to fit more with the component breakdown, alongwith the data flow diagram to contain more processes and data stores. We decided to create a different sequence diagram than the current, so that it covered a more critical workflow. We redelegated some of the remaining tasks, and decided to reconvene later in the day through messages.

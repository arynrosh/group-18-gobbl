- In today's meeting, we went over progress for Milestone 2. We discussed some of the diagrams we individually created and altered them according to group suggestions.
- We fixed the class diagram to fit more with the component breakdown, alongwith the data flow diagram to contain more processes and data stores.
- We reformated the component identification to be more in line with the system architecture.
- We decided to create a different sequence diagram than a current one, so that it covered a more critical workflow (order delivery).
- We redelegated some of the remaining tasks, and decided to reconvene later in the day through messages.
- We decided to start our next sprint for M3 while reading break has started, and plan to meet in the following week to plan and get started on the backend.
